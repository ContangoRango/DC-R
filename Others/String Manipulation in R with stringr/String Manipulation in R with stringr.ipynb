    "Let's get started by entering some strings in R. In the video you saw that you use quotes to tell R to interpret something as a string. Both double quotes (\") and single (') quotes work, but there are some guidelines for which to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should prefer double quotes (\") to single quotes ('). That means, whenever you are defining a string your first intuition should be to use \".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately if your string has \" inside it, R will interpret the double quote as \"this is the end of the string\", not as \"this is the character \"\". This is one time you can forget the first guideline and use the single quote, ', to define the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are cases where you need both ' and \" inside the string. In this case, fall back to the first guideline and use \" to define the string, but you'll have to escape any double quotes inside the string using a backslash (i.e. \\\").\n",

    "\n",
    "The behavior of format() can be pretty confusing, so you'll spend most of this exercise exploring how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video, the scientific argument to format() controls whether the numbers are displayed in fixed (scientific = FALSE) or scientific (scientific = TRUE) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the representation is scientific, the digits argument is the number of digits before the exponent. When the representation is fixed, digits controls the significant digits used for the smallest (in magnitude) number. Each other number will be formatted to match the number of decimal places in the smallest number. This means the number of decimal places you get in your output depends on all the values you are formatting!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the smallest number is 0.0011, and digits = 1, then 0.0011 requires 3 places after the decimal to represent it to 1 significant digit, 0.001. Every other number will be formatted to 3 places after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how many decimal places will you get if 1.0011 is the smallest number? You'll find out in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    " - Format c(0.0011, 0.011, 1) with digits = 1. This is like the example described above.\n",
    " - Now, format c(1.0011, 2.011, 1) with digits = 1. Try to predict what you might get before you try it.\n",
    " - Format percent_change by choosing the digits argument so that the values are presented with one place after the decimal point.\n",
    " - Format income by choosing the digits argument so that the values are presented as whole numbers (i.e. no places after the decimal point).\n",

    "The function formatC() provides an alternative way to format numbers based on C style syntax.\n",

    "Rather than a scientific argument, formatC() has a format argument that takes a code representing the required format. The most useful are:\n",

    " - \"f\" for fixed,\n",
    " - \"e\" for scientific, and\n",
    " - \"g\" for fixed unless scientific saves space\n",
    " \n",
    "When using scientific format, the digits argument behaves like it does in format(); it specifies the number of significant digits. However, unlike format(), when using fixed format, digits is the number of digits after the decimal point. This is more predictable than format(), because the number of places after the decimal is fixed regardless of the values being formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "formatC() also formats numbers individually, which means you always get the same output regardless of other numbers in the vector.\n",

    "### Parsing strings into variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use for str_split() is to pull apart raw string data into more useful variables. In this exercise you'll start by pulling apart a date range, something like \"23.01.2017 - 29.01.2017\", into separate variables for the start of the range, \"23.01.2017\", and the end of the range, \"29.01.2017\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, if the simplify argument is FALSE (the default) you'll get back a list of the same length as that of the input vector. More commonly, you'll want to pull out the first piece (or second piece etc.) from every element, which is easier if you specify simplify = TRUE and get a matrix as output. You'll explore both of these output types in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    " - Split date_ranges using \" - \" as a pattern, assign this to split_dates. Don't forget to wrap the pattern in fixed().\n",
    " - Print split_dates. The result is a list with two elements, since date_ranges was a vector of length two.\n",
    " - Now, split date_ranges again, but specify simplify = TRUE and n = 2. Print the result to see the difference. Now we get a matrix back, where each row corresponds to an element of date_ranges.\n",
    " - Pull out the first column of split_dates_n into start_dates, and the second column into end_dates.\n",
    " - Split start_dates into its day, month and year components. You are aiming for a three column matrix as the result.\n",
    " - Now you're on your own. We've provided the both_names vector, listing a couple of famous statisticians. Your job is to pull out the first names and last names into separate vectors. You'll need to use an intermediate variable, both_names_split."
