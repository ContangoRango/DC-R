Hi, and welcome to week 6 of 15.053x.
And this week we're going to talk
about nonlinear programming.

Non-linear optimization and non-linear programming
mean the same thing.
And so what is non-linear optimization?
We saw it in week 1, and it's really
the same as either linear programming, or integer
programming, in terms of the paradigm.
We're going to minimize or maximize a single objective,
subject to a number of constraints.
The only difference in non-linear optimization
is that the objective and the constraints
are permitted to be non-linear.
Here's a three dimensional picture,
where here's the minimum value.

An overview of what I'm going to talk about over this week
is portfolio optimization.
There'll be several videos on that.
We're going to talk about convex functions and convex
sets, which we first talked about in week 2.
We're going to discuss local optimization
versus global optimization.
And that will conclude with that certain types
of-- certain types of non-linear programs are easy,
and it's the convex minimization problems that are easy.
And then we'll give a couple more applications
of non-linear programming.
