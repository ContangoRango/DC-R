    "A time series can be thought of as a vector or matrix of numbers along with some information about what times those numbers were recorded. This information is stored in a ts object in R. In most exercises, you will use time series that are part of existing packages. However, if you want to work with your own data, you need to know how to create a ts object in R.\n",

    " - Use the read_excel() function to read the data from \"exercise1.xlsx\" into mydata.\n",
    " - Apply head() to mydata in the R console to inspect the first few lines of the data. Take a look at the dates - there are four observations in 1981, indicating quarterly data with a frequency of four rows per year. The first observation or start date is Mar-81, the first of four rows for year 1981, indicating that March corresponds with the first period.\n",
    " - Create a ts object called myts using ts(). Set data, start and frequency based on what you observed."
